            Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or
            feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human
            contact.</span

            Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
            ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
            various cat registries.</span

            The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a
            common ancestor about 10-15 million years ago. he earliest known
            indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was
            excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos,
            southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500-7200 BC. Since there is no
            evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of
            this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild
            mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.</span

            The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. In the
            early 1980s, it was about seven years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995
            and about 15 years in 2021. Some cats have been reported as
            surviving into their 30s,with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff,
            dying at a verified age of 38. Cats are a crucial part in the human
            life, it's important to know them and take care of them
            properly.</span
